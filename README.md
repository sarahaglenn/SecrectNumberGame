# ☕️ Overview

This program runs a number guessing game that generates a random number and then gives the player a limited number of chances to guess the number. The game provides feedback to the player after each guess, indicating whether the secret number is higher or lower. If players guess correctly within the limit, and the score is higher than the current 5th place score, their score is added to the leaderboard. The high scores are loaded from a file (if it exists).

The purpose of writing this program was to get a foundational understanding of using Java to write a simple, interactive number guessing game incorporating variables, loops, user input, and file handling.
